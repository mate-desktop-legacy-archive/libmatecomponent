Objects activated by factories cannot automatically be activated via a
different ObjectDirectory than the factory itself.

Note that when activating a factory in the process of activating an
object, the context of the ObjectDirectory will be used, not the
context of the client.

Shared libraries servers must be activated from an ObjectDirectory on
the same host as the activating client. File accessability checking is
not normally done.
