libmatecomponent is the non-GUI part of the matecomponent component infrastructure,
it is most useful for creating aggregate interfaces & doing IPC
easily. It also contains a rather badly designed & implemented
per-system activation system. This needs re-writing & simplifying to
be per-display.

Take a look at samples/echo/.

This is the distribution of MateComponent, the MATE component and compound
document system for the GNU system.

* What is MateComponent

   MateComponent is a set of language and system independant CORBA interfaces
   for creating reusable components, controls and creating compound
   documents.

   The MateComponent distribution includes a Gtk+ based implementation of the
   MateComponent interfaces, enabling developers to create reusable
   components and applications that can be used to form more complex
   documents.

   If you want to look into a Java implementation of MateComponent, look in
   the MATE CVS for the `monkeybeans' module (Erdi Gergo is the
   author), you can browse it at: http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai

* Licensing

   MateComponent libraries are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (GNU LGPL).  While components and programs
   included with this release are licensed under the terms of the GNU
   General Public License (GNU GPL).

   You can find copies of the licenses in the files COPYING.LIB and
   COPYING for the libraries and the code respectively.

* Bug reports

   File any bug reports at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/

* What you will need

   You will need a working MATE 2.x system with the development tools
   to compile and install MateComponent.

* Mailing lists

   mate-components-list@gnome.org

   To subscribe, send mail to mate-components-list-request@gnome.org
   and in the body of the message put the word "subscribe".

   Archive of the mailing list is available at:

     http://mail.gnome.org/archives/mate-components-list

* The layout

   You will find documentation for MateComponent in the "doc" directory.  The
   actual implementation of matecomponent is in the "matecomponent" directory.  The
   CORBA interfaces are in the "idl" directory.  Sample implementations
   of components and containers are in the "samples" directory.  You
   should use these implementations as your reference when you write
   MateComponent code.

* MateComponents

   The real MateComponents are endangered species.  If you want to help
preserve the MateComponents go to this web site:
